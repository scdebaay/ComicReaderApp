# ComicReaderApp
Universal App Using the ComicCloud API to read Comics from an online repo.
Tested and developed on Android. Not yet gotten around seting it up on iOS. Perhaps someone can help? 
I don't have access to anything Apple related.
Comic Cloud API can be found on: https://github.com/scdebaay/WWW.DE-BAAY.NL-Online-Comic-Reader
This repo also includes a web front-end reader.

The app uses JSON.NET, CrossFire Photobrowser and Plugin.Settings NuGet packages.
